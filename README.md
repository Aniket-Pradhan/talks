# Byld Sessions
For keeping track of all the events by Byld

## How to use it?

### For the general audience

- Suggest events you want to be organized by Byld (in the *Issues* section)
- Suggest improvements in the current/proposed offering of an event (in the *Issues* section)
- Get the first update on the new/proposed events(If you watch the repo)

### For volunteers

Showcase that you volunteered for an event. Since volunteering for Byld events is one of the membership criteria, we will be using this repo to keep track of your contribution as a volunteer.   
You can actively participate in the event discussion to suggest improvement(in content, organization, or anything you want).  
Maintaining this repo is a bit tedious. Hence, any help would be appreciated.

### For speakers

Prospective speakers can choose events from ["Issues" marked as "speaker-needed"](https://github.com/IIIT-Delhi/talks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aspeakers-needed) or you can [propose a new event](https://github.com/IIIT-Delhi/talks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=proposed_events%2C+speakers-needed&template=event-proposal.md&title=).

The speaker is supposed to send a PR to this repo for adding the content for his event.
