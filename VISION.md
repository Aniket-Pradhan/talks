# IIIT-Delhi/talks

This aim of this repo 

- To keep track of **all** the events organized by Byld transparently and decently.
- People can propose new events as a speaker or an audience.
- Ease the process of feedback/suggestion for an event
- Ease the process of volunteering for an event.
- Act as the first notification system for proposed or scheduled events to the people who "watch" the repo.

## Materials

A proper log of the events will help future organizers and speakers to reuse materials and learn lessons from it. We will try to:

- Keep materials in this repo to avoid broken links in the future
- Keep both the rendered and source material
- Add feedbacks for future sessions
- Additional resources
